# Struggles I've met:
1. I thought I will have a good use for Boostrap on this assignment but turned out it's not. I prefer to have full control over the style and layout of my website. Using bootstrap limited the style.css adjustment ability.
2. To make the responsive menu, I took prefrerences from https://codepen.io/abhaysharma/pen/wvMmKOo
3.  Back to top button: https://codepen.io/yying6/pen/yGhHu

4. I got really depressed after I look up preferences, I realized I can't make my website as good as them
