# Struggles I've met:
1. I thought I will have a good use for Boostrap on this assignment but turned out it's not. I prefer to have full control over the style and layout of my website. Using bootstrap limited the style.css adjustment ability.

2. I got really depressed after I look up preferences, I realized I can't make my website as good as them

3. My goal is for a website with the least use of Javascript because I haven't understand it yet

4. I tried to make the form in contact page active by following this link (https://qhmit.com/html/codes/html_form_to_email.cfm) but it doesn't work. I have no knowledge on .php yet so just leave it there showcase for now.
