# Struggles I've met:
1. I thought I will have a good use for Boostrap on this assignment but turned out it's not. I prefer to have full control over the style and layout of my website. Using bootstrap limited the style.css adjustment ability.
2. To make the responsive menu, I took prefrerences from https://codepen.io/abhaysharma/pen/wvMmKOo
3.  Back to top button: https://codepen.io/yying6/pen/yGhHu

4. I got really depressed after I look up preferences, I realized I can't make my website as good as them

5. Image gallery: https://codepen.io/stefcharle/pen/Gydvbx 

6. I tried to make the form in contact page active by following this link (https://qhmit.com/html/codes/html_form_to_email.cfm) but it doesn't work. I have no knowledge on .php yet so just leave it there showcase for now.
